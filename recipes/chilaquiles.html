      <h1>CHILAQUILES</h1>
      <img src="../images/chilaquiles-image.jpg" />
      <p>
        At its most basic, chilaquiles consist of fried corn tortilla chips
        simmered in a brothy sauce. Not only is this dish affordable, but it’s
        also great for entertaining since both major components (the chips and
        the sauce) can be made in advance.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Corn tortilla</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Garnishes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Fry the tortillas. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high
          heat until shimmering. Add about a quarter of the tortilla wedges and
          cook, flipping once, until lightly brown and crisp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the tortilla chips. Drain the freshly fried tortilla chips on a
          paper towel-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Repeat
          this process until all tortillas are fried, adding more oil if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the salsa roja. Place the tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, and garlic
          in a blender or food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pour
          in a cup of the broth. Blend until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the salsa. Heat a couple teaspoons of oil in a large skillet over
          medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the salsa and cook, stirring
          occasionally, until slightly thickened. Add additional broth to thin
          out the salsa, if needed. Taste and season with salt as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coat the chips with the salsa. Add the tortilla chips and stir
          carefully to coat the chips. Cook until the tortillas are heated
          through. Taste and season with salt as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve warm. Serve warm garnished with avocado or guacamole, crema,
          queso fresco, and/or fried eggs, if desired.
        </li>
      </ol>
